The steps involved in DES are:
1. Initial Permutation
2. Rounds
    a. Expansion Permutation
    b. XOR with round key
    c. Substitution (S-box)
    d. Last permutation
3. 32-bit swap
4. Inverse Initial Permutation

The steps involved in Key generation are:
1. Input key is permuted by choice 1 (done)
2. Separate into two segments (done)
3. Both circularly shifted 1-2 bits (done)
4. Permuted by choice 2 (done???)
5. 3-4 repeated each round

64 bit key input, first 56 are independent and last 8 are parity checking
